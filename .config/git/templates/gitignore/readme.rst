A collection of ``.gitignore`` templates
========================================

Directories structure
---------------------

-  ``root`` directory contains templates in common use, to help people
   get started with popular programming languages and technologies.
   These define a meaningful set of rules to help get started, and
   ensure you are not committing unimportant files into your repository.

-  ```base`` <./base>`__ directory contains templates for various
   editors, tools and operating systems that can be used in different
   situations. It is recommended that you either add these to your
   global template or merge these rules into your project-specific
   templates if you want to use them permanently.

-  ```specific`` <./specific>`__ directory contains specialized
   templates for other popular languages, tools and project, which donâ€™t
   currently belong in the root templates. These should be added to your
   project-specific templates when you decide to adopt the framework or
   tool.
