# font family. you can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. by default they are derived automatically,
# by the oses font system. setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like book, medium, thick, etc. for example:
# font_family      operator mono book
# bold_font        operator mono thick
# bold_italic_font operator mono medium

# symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). map the

# rendering for some symbols, such as for powerline. avoids the need for
# patched fonts. each unicode code point is specified in the form U+<code point
# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# syntax is:
#
# symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

# for example:
#
#symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols
